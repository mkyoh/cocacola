    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Ethiopia is one of the world's oldest nations with a
      rich history dating back to the Aksumite Empire around 100 AD. Known as
      the cradle of humanity, it has a long tradition of Christianity and a
      unique script, Ge'ez. The country was never colonized, maintaining its
      independence except for a brief Italian occupation from 1936 to 1941.
      Overview of Ethiopia Located in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia is the
      second-most populous nation in Africa with over 115 million people. Its
      capital, Addis Ababa, is the political and economic hub. Ethiopia is
      known for its diverse cultures, languages, and landscapes, ranging from
      highlands to lowland deserts. FMCG Sector in Ethiopia The FMCG sector in
      Ethiopia, which includes products like food, beverages, and personal
      care items, began to grow significantly in the late 20th century. Key
      drivers of this growth include urbanization, rising disposable incomes,
      and changing consumer preferences. Major international brands like
      Coca-Cola, Unilever, and Nestl√© have established a strong presence.<br />

            <b>Inflation and Consumer Impact:</b><br>
            High Inflation: Consumer buying power is being adversely affected by high inflation, especially in food
            prices, which have averaged 42%, surpassing the national average of 37%.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Market and Traffic Ban Impact:</b><br>
            Traffic Ban: A traffic ban in the Addis market has disrupted the redistribution process and impacted the
            Profit and Loss (P&L) of OCCD.
          </p>
